      <h2>Buy Furniture With Confidence</h2>

      <section class="feature-card">
        <p>
          Furniture is expensive — and most of what's sold right now is designed to look good in
          photos for about six months and then fall apart. The goal of this guide is to help you tell the
          difference between "Instagram cute" and "built to live with."
        </p>

        <p>
          We'll walk through which materials actually hold up, how to spot cheap construction in the
          store, and when it's smart to invest versus when it's totally fine to buy the budget version.
        </p>

        <p>
          By the end, you should feel confident walking into a furniture store and knowing what
          questions to ask, what parts to touch, and what to ignore from the salesperson.
        </p>

      <!-- SECTION 2: HOW TO CHECK QUALITY -->
      <section class="feature-card">
        <h3>How To Check Quality In Person</h3>
        <p>
          These are fast, no-tools, in-store tests you can do without looking weird:
        </p>

        <p><strong>• Shake Test</strong><br>
          Gently hold the furniture and rock it side to side. A solid piece shouldn't wobble or rattle.
          If it's already loose on the showroom floor, it will be worse at home.
        </p>

        <p><strong>• Weight &amp; Balance</strong><br>
          Heavier is not always better, but "feels hollow" is usually bad. Lightweight can be fine for
          accent pieces. For daily-use pieces (sofa, dresser, dining chairs), you don't want them to feel
          flimsy or top-heavy.
        </p>

        <p><strong>• Drawer Test</strong><br>
          Open drawers all the way and look at how they're attached. Smooth glide? Full extension? Are
          the sides of the drawer actual wood or thin particle board? Do the bottoms bow when you press
          down? Bowing = sagging in 3 months.
        </p>

        <p><strong>• Joint Test</strong><br>
          Look under tables and chairs. Are the legs just stapled into place, or are there screws /
          dowels / brackets holding things together? Visible metal brackets and reinforced corners are
          good. Glue and staples alone are not.
        </p>

        <p><strong>• Surface Check</strong><br>
          Run your hand along the edges. If it feels like plastic film peeling up, that's laminate that
          will chip fast. A tiny chip in the store = huge peeling corner at home.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Mini red-flag list for instant "no":</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>You can see nails or staples sticking out underneath.</li>
          <li>The finish is already bubbling or cracking.</li>
          <li>The legs aren't level on a flat showroom floor.</li>
          <li>The cushion feels like air when you sit down, not layered foam.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h3>Materials: What You're Actually Buying</h3>

      <!-- SECTION 4: SPEND VS SAVE -->
      <section class="feature-card">
        <h3>Where to Spend vs Where to Save</h3>
        <p>This is how you avoid wasting money.</p>

        <p><strong>Spend On:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sofa —</strong> You sit on it every single day. Cheap cushions flatten fast and you end up replacing the whole thing. Look for a strong frame and cushions with layered foam + fill, not just air-puff padding.</li>
          <li><strong>Mattress —</strong> Sleep = health. Obvious.</li>
          <li><strong>Dining Chairs —</strong> Wobbly chairs are a safety issue, and you feel bad asking guests to sit in them.</li>
          <li><strong>Dresser / Storage —</strong> Drawers that stick and bottoms that fall out will drive you insane.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Save On:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Side Tables / Nightstands —</strong> These don't take heavy stress. You can swap styles later without guilt.</li>
          <li><strong>Trend Pieces —</strong> Bright boucle ottoman? Curvy accent chair in rust velvet? Fun today, dated in two years. Don't overspend here.</li>
          <li><strong>Shelving / Bookcases —</strong> If it's just there to hold plants and candles, MDF is perfectly fine.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Rule of thumb:</strong><br>
          Invest in the things that hold weight, motion, or your body.<br>
          Go cheap on "cute surface areas."
        </p>

      <!-- SECTION 5: BUYING CHECKLIST -->
      <section class="feature-card">
        <h3>Buying Checklist (Use This In Store)</h3>
        <p>You can literally keep this in your Notes app:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>☐ Does it wobble when I push it?</li>
          <li>☐ Are the legs/brackets solid metal or just stapled wood?</li>
          <li>☐ Are drawers smooth all the way out, or do they catch?</li>
          <li>☐ Is the cushion supportive or just puffy air?</li>
          <li>☐ Are edges already dented/scraped in the store (meaning they'll get worse at home)?</li>
          <li>☐ Will this still match my style in 2–3 years, or am I chasing a trend photo?</li>
        </ul>
      </section>


      <!-- SECTION 6: BOTTOM LINE -->
      <section class="feature-card">
        <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
        <p>
          Good furniture does not mean designer furniture.
        </p>

        <p>
          You're looking for three things:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Stability</strong> — does it feel sturdy today?</li>
          <li><strong>Longevity</strong> — can it survive real life: kids, pets, spills, moving once or twice?</li>
          <li><strong>Value</strong> — am I paying for actual materials or just the brand name and staging?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you slow down and check those three, you'll buy less impulsively, and you'll end up with
          pieces you actually trust — not just pieces you're babysitting.
